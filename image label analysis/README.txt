**Description:**

This Python script provides a utility for comparing the contents of two folders containing images and labels.
 It is particularly useful in the context of data preprocessing for tasks such as object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once)
  where images and their corresponding label files (often in YOLO format) need to be synchronized.

**Functionality:**

- **`compare_folders(folder1, folder2)`:** 
  - This function compares the filenames (without extensions) in two folders.
  - It identifies missing files in each folder and prints the names of the missing files, if any.
  - If both folders contain the same set of filenames, it prints "Folders are identical."
  - This comparison is essential for ensuring data consistency in tasks like object detection, where each image must have a corresponding label file.

**Use Case:**

This script is beneficial during the data preprocessing stage of projects involving object detection,
 especially when using YOLO. By comparing the contents of image and label folders,
  it helps identify missing files, thus ensuring data consistency and avoiding errors during model training.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose you're working on a YOLO-based object detection project. 
You have a folder containing images and another folder containing label files corresponding to those images. 
Before training the model, you want to ensure that each image has its corresponding label file and vice versa.
 You can use this script to compare the two folders and identify any missing files, 
 thus maintaining data integrity and preventing inconsistencies during training.

**Advantages:**

- Helps maintain data consistency by ensuring that every image has a corresponding label file, and vice versa.
- Facilitates error detection and prevention during data preprocessing, thereby improving the quality of the training dataset.
- Saves time by automating the process of comparing folder contents, 
especially when dealing with large datasets.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, this Python script provides a simple yet effective solution for comparing the contents of image and label folders, 
making it a valuable tool for ensuring data consistency and integrity in YOLO-based object detection projects.
